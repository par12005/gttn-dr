Species and Data Type Information
---------------------------------

This page will allow you to specify the species associated with your data and the data types you will be submitting:

.. image:: ../../../images/species_information.png

You can add as many species to your submission as you would like. The species fields will autocomplete your entries to species that are already present in the database. If your species is not in the database, that's ok! When you complete your submission a new species will be added.

You will then need to select all of the data types you will be submitting. Your options are Sample, DART, Isotope, Genetic, and Anatomy data. Your selection here will influence the fields you will see in later in the form.
